###  Here's an explanation of the Solidity code for the Real Estate Transactions dApp:
 1. Contract Structure: The code starts with the declaration of a Solidity contract named "RealEstateTransactions" that includes various state variables, events, and mappings to store and manage properties, buyers, sellers, transaction data, and rewards.
 2. Modifiers: The code includes a modifier called "onlyAdmin" which restricts access to certain functions only to the designated admins. This can be used to add an additional layer of security and control.
 3. Structs: The code defines a struct called "Property" that represents a real estate property with properties like ID, name, seller, buyer, price, and rental status.
 4. Constructor: The contract constructor sets the initial admin and adds them to the admins mapping.
 5. Property Management Functions:
  - addProperty: Allows an admin to add a new property to the dApp by providing the property details like name, price, and seller's address.
  - rentProperty: Allows a buyer to rent a property by providing the property ID, payment amount, and buyer's address. It handles escrow, transfers the payment to the seller, and emits events for property rental and transfer.
  - transferProperty: Allows the current buyer of a property to transfer the property ownership to a new owner by providing the property ID and the new owner's address.

6. Tracking Top Buyers and Sellers: The code includes functions to track the top buyers and sellers based on the number of purchases and sales they have made. The functions checkTopSeller and checkTopBuyer compare the current buyer or seller's purchase or sale count with the existing top buyer or seller count, and if the current count is higher, it updates the top buyer or seller and emits an event for reward.

7. Getters and Utility Functions: The code includes various getter functions to retrieve property details, account balances, top buyers, and sellers. It also includes utility functions like mintNFT to mint NFTs as rewards, withdrawFunds to allow users to withdraw their balances, and getContractBalance to check the contract's balance.

8. Admin Functions: The code includes functions to reward the top buyer and seller with NFTs. These functions can only be called by designated admins, as defined by the onlyAdmin modifier.

9. isAdmin Function: The code includes a function to check if an address is an admin or not.
